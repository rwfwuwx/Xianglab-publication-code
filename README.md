## What's in here
The lab's work (http://www.xianglab.com.cn/col.jsp?id=105) is performed on the 11buddy-&-I research platform (https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I).

From 2024, as 11buddies grow up, we present them here along with the publication, which is critical for resarch integrety and replication. 

For each publicated work, we show how ada generate the reported results: 
- fill in the **ada_requirement_table**

  i.e., tell ada your requirements for generating the reported results.
  
  The table is in the .xlsx format.

- ask ada to generate the **ada_report_file**

  given your requirement, ada asks for the necessary data/info from other 11buddies, and generates the report file.
  The report file contains the exact reported results including the statistical texts, tables, figures, along with the codes generating them.

  The report file is in the .docx or .mlx formart.

Note: For the end-to-end 11buddy research pipeline of a study from the beginnign data collection ... to the result reporting here, i.e., the Study_TaskList, please see https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I.

Note: The ada_report_file was in the .docx or .mlx formart, which is not supported for uploading in github. A .pdf version is thus attached instead.

Note: The most recent 11buddies are presented here, and may look not exactly the same as they were originally with pubilication months/years before (it's normal, they are growing up).
