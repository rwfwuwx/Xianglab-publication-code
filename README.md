## What's in here
The lab's work (http://www.xianglab.com.cn/col.jsp?id=105) is performed on the 11buddy-&-I research platform (https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I).

From 2024, as 11buddies grow up, we present them here along with the publication, which is critical for resarch apparency and replication. 

For each publicated work, we show how ada generate the reported results: 
- fill in the **ada_requirement_table**

  i.e., tell ada the needs for generating the reported results.

- ask ada to generate the **ada_report_file**

  given the ada_requirement_table, ada asks for required data/info from other 11buddies, and generates the report file containing the exact reported results, including statistical texts, tables, figures.

Note that, for the whole end-to-end 11buddy research pipeline of a study, please see the description at https://github.com/rwfwuwx/11buddy-and-I.
